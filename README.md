## About The Project

This project is the implementation of one of the data structures "AVL Tree".  
If you are someone who is interested in data structures, trees, one of the first structures that come to your mind, are very important to us. For this reason, I implemented AVL trees in order to learn these structures better and to improve myself and I am sharing them with you.  
**In addition to other AVL Tree implementation, it also stores the movement of nodes in the stack.**

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org)
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org)

## Getting Started

Before examining the project, we need to know about AVL trees.

### AVL Tree

In computer science, an AVL tree (named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary search tree.  
It was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.

## Usage

1. Get a  python  at [HERE](https://www.python.org) and Install
2. Open file folder from command line
```sh
cd desktop/AVL-Tree-Data-Structures
```
3. Run Makefile for compile process
```sh
mingw32-make
```
4. Open bin folder from command line or file explorer
```
cd.. / for move back folder
cd bin
program.exe
```
